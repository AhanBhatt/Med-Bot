# Med-Bot
An AI-powered assistant to provide accurate and reliable medical information to users' queries and concerns.

#Libraries & Frameworks -
1) PyTorch
2) Flask
3) Tensorflow

#Literature Review
The integration of llama-assisted data processing and AutoGPT-Q for training a chatbot that answers medical questions using PDFs of medical books showcases a unique and promising approach. This innovative method offers improved accuracy, reliability, and depth in medical question-answering, contributing to the advancement of AI-powered healthcare information dissemination. Further research and development in this direction are warranted to fully exploit the potential of this approach.

#Working 
A context-based chatbot understands ongoing conversations, identifies user intent and relevant information, generates responses using machine learning, and maintains context for coherent interactions. It tracks the conversation flow, personalizes responses, and learns from user feedback to improve over time, providing more natural and relevant interactions.

#Instructions:
1) Create a folder titled "Data" in the project directory
2) Transfer all your medical e-books to that folder in pdf format
3)
